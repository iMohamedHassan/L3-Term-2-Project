# Dynamic Web Page Project

## Description
This project is a dynamic web page that demonstrates the use of JavaScript to create interactive and responsive web elements. The page includes a dynamically generated navigation bar, smooth scrolling, active section highlighting, and a functional comment form.

## Features
- **Dynamic Navigation Bar**: Automatically generated based on the sections of the page.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Smoothly scrolls to the selected section when a navigation link is clicked.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: Visibly highlights the section currently in the viewport.
- **Comment Form**:
  - Allows users to submit their name, email, and comment.
  - Validates input fields to ensure all fields are filled and the email is valid.
  - Displays submitted comments in the "Comments" section.
  - Prepopulates the "Comments" section with default comments.
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: A button that appears when the user scrolls below the fold and scrolls the page to the top when clicked.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Dynamic Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For more detailed requirements, see the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
